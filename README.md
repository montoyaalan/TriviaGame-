# TriviaGame-
This is the repository for Homework assignment 5. The second jQuery assignment. 

I went with option one: "Basic Quiz (Timed Form)"

Then I followed a blog post that actually walked me through the Advanced Assignment.
By accident I completed the advanced assignemnt!

The theme for my Trivia Assignment is 90's Pop Culture. 

This assignment was tricky as I used the previous homework and in class activities for inspiration.
Had Tutor from before HEAVILY walk me through as well as used a blog post to guide me through the skeleton of what the code should look like. The styling was taken from an instructional YouTube video. 

Instructions:

Overview
In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

Submission on BCS
Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
Before You Begin
Create a GitHub repo called TriviaGame, then clone the repo to your computer.

Create a file inside of the TriviaGame folder called index.html. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.

Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.

Create a folder inside of the TriviaGame folder called assets.

Inside assets, create three folders: css, javascript, images

In your css folder, create a style.css file.
In your javascript folder, create an app.js file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
In your images folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.
Choose a game to build from your options below.

You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.

The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

Don't forget to include a countdown timer.
